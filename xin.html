  @description

  This is main module of `xin`. This module consists of basic modules as steroid
  to work with new webcomponents specification of HTML.

  When developing web application using xin as web components library, developers

@component xin-repeat

The `xin-repeat` element is a HTMLTemplateElement based component that automatically iterate
through items (an array implementation provided by user) to create chunk of template binds
to each item (member of array provided by user). xin-repeat accepts an items property, and
one instance of the template is rendered for each item into the DOM at the location of the component.
The item property will be set on each instance's binding scope, thus templates should bind to sub-properties of item.

```html
<template is="xin-template" for="employee-list">
  <div>Employee list:</div>
  <template is="xin-repeat" items="{{employees}}">
      <div>First name: <span>{{item.first}}</span></div>
      <div>Last name: <span>{{item.last}}</span></div>
  </template>
</template>

<script>
  xin.createComponent({
    is: 'employee-list',
    ready: function() {
      this.employees = [
          {first: 'Bob', last: 'Smith'},
          {first: 'Sally', last: 'Johnson'},
          ...
      ];
    }
  });
</script>
